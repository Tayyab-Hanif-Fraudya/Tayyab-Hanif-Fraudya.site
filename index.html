                <!-- Subheading and Bullet Points -->
                <h4>1. Early Beginnings (2014-2016): </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Initial Ventures: </b> Tayyab began his criminal journey in Sarai Alamgir, Gujrat, 
                        where he engaged in small-scale frauds targeting local businesses and individuals. 
                        Presenting himself as a budding entrepreneur, he convinced people to invest in fake business ventures.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Small-Scale Scams: </b> In these early years, Tayyab refined his deception techniques. He 
                        would often claim to be involved in import/export businesses, taking advance payments 
                        from clients and then disappearing without delivering the promised goods.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Family Influence: </b> Tayyab was influenced by certain family members, who themselves 
                        were involved in fraudulent activities. His family background provided the foundation for 
                        his future criminal enterprises, which became larger and more sophisticated.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>2. Expansion and Diversification (2016-2018): </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Launch of Apnapasa.com: </b> Around 2016-2017, Tayyab launched a fraudulent website 
                        named Apnapasa.com, which posed as a financial services platform. This scam, conducted 
                        mainly through LinkedIn, attracted victims seeking loans or investment opportunities. The 
                        website was eventually shut down after defrauding multiple individuals.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Shell Companies: </b> To facilitate fraud, Tayyab set up multiple shell companies, including 
                        Taha Enterprise and Kalu Motors. These companies were used to launder money and 
                        conduct fraudulent transactions across Pakistan and abroad.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Establishing a Network: </b> Tayyab developed a network of family members and associates 
                        who played key roles in helping him carry out fraudulent activities. His influence grew as he 
                        involved more people in his schemes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. National and International Scams (2018-2020): </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>International Expansion: </b>By 2018, Tayyab expanded his fraudulent operations beyond 
                        Pakistan, particularly targeting individuals in the UAE, Spain, and the UK. He used fake 
                        business deals, investments, and gambling platforms to extract money from his victims.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Defaulter Status in UAE: </b>His illegal trading and fraudulent activities in the UAE led to his 
                        status as a defaulter, with debts exceeding 100K AED to financial institutions like Dunia 
                        Finance LLC. Legal actions were initiated, but Tayyab fled before they could be enforced.

                        E257/24. Despite his incarceration, he continued his fraudulent activities through his family

                        made several attempts to escape custody. His frequent tactic involves feigning severe 
                        health problems, such as liver issues, to secure hospital transfers where he can attempt an 
                        escape. His family, especially his uncle Abdul Hafeez, residing in Spain, is suspected of

                <h3 id=" Threat_Assessment">Threat Assessment</h3>
                <h4>Threat Level: <b>EXTREMELY HIGH</b></h4>
                <p> Tayyab Hanif Fraudya is a dangerous individual with an extensive history of fraud, deception, 
                    and illegal activities spanning multiple countries. His criminal network, use of multiple identities, 
                    and ability to exploit both family and associates make him a significant threat. His lack of 
                    empathy, coupled with his gambling addiction, ensures that he will continue to defraud new 
                    victims unless stopped.
                </p>
                <h4>Recommendations: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Continued Surveillance:</b> Close monitoring is required, especially while he is incarcerated, 
                        to prevent escape attempts.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Asset Seizure and Freezing of Bank Accounts:</b> All known assets and bank accounts 
                        linked to Tayyab and his family should be frozen to prevent further laundering of illicit 
                        funds.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Intervention with Family:</b> Engaging with Tayyab’s family, particularly those residing 
                        abroad, is crucial to cut off his escape routes and secure cooperation with authorities.
